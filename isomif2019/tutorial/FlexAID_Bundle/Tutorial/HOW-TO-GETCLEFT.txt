This tutorial explains how to define a binding-site using GetCleft.

We use the variable $GetCleft as to define the GetCleft executable throughout.
$GetCleft = GetCleft (Linux or MacOSX), or
$GetCleft = GetCleft.exe (Windows)

$Platform refers to the platform of the bundle you downloaded, either
  Linux32, Linux64, Win32, Win64 or MacOSX64


Open a terminal, and execute the following commands:

  # Move into the Tutorial directory
  cd FlexAID_Bundle/Tutorial
  
  ----------

  # To generate all possible clefts for Streptavidin, run GetCleft on the complex as follows:
  ../$Platform/GetCleft/$GetCleft -p Processed_files/1stp.pdb -o Clefts/clefts -s
  
  # Outputted sphere files (sph-tagged) are PDB files that can be visualized in PyMOL
  # Display them as 'spheres' in PyMOL for clarity
  
  # If you wish to only generate clefts in contact with Biotin,
  # specify the RESNUMC of the ligand in the PDB, followed by '-'
  ../$Platform/GetCleft/$GetCleft -p Processed_files/1stp.pdb -o Clefts/clefts_ligand -s -a BTN300A-
  
  ----------
  
  # To do a global search in all possible clefts of Streptavidin
  # Combine all sphere files into a single one
  cat Clefts/clefts_sph_* >Binding_sites/global_binding_site.pdb  
  
  # To do a search in the cleft where Biotin is
  # Combine all clefts in contact with Biotin into a single one
  cat Clefts/clefts_ligand_*sph* >Binding_sites/biotin_binding_site.pdb
